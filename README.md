| `/adminlist`            | Generates an admin rank-ordered list. Paste your admin roster or upload a `.txt` for result.  |

## Scheduler

- Uses **APScheduler** to send daily task messages at 06:00 MSK to a specific channel.  
- This is useful for automatic daily missions or reminders.

## Version History

### Latest version: `1.2.2`

#### Previous Changelog Highlights

- Modular redesign using **Cog architecture**
- Unified slash/prefix command handling
- Enhanced timezone utilities (UTC+1, UTC+3, UTC+9, custom offset support)
- Scheduled task automation for daily operations
- Adminlist parser for roster processing via message/attachment

*Versions marked Beta are for internal/testing use only.*

## Guild/Channel Setup

- The bot uses **guild whitelisting** for admin-specific commands.  
- Make sure to update `ALL_GUILD_IDS` and `ADMIN_GUILD_IDS` to your guild/server IDs.
- Daily task messages use a hardcoded channel IDâ€”update as necessary for your environment!

## Customization

1. **Daily Tasks**:  
   Edit `WEEKLY_TASKS` in the code for your own community's recurring assignments.
2. **Guilds**:  
   Update your server IDs in the code blocks for `ALL_GUILD_IDS` and `ADMIN_GUILD_IDS`.
3. **Message/Presence**:  
   Adjust the bot's status message or scheduled time as you prefer in the code.

## Deployment Tips

- For continuous uptime (esp. on free hosts), use a webserver ping (see `keep_alive.py`).
- To enable slash command registration in all guilds, consider syncing on every `on_ready`.
